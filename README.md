# 2DRelativity

A little fun with openGL shader to simulate a top-down view of an observer close to a black hole as well as a 3d renderer, aiming for a physically correct render

Use arrows to move around black hole and hold shift to move faster

Spacebar activates the black hole visuals and the 2/3 number keys to switch between renderers.
The R key reloads the shader if you want to experiment without re-executing the binary
